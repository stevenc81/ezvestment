Hi Dave,

Interviews
=

Today I have given some time to interview 2 individuals with very different perspective

Seasoned Investor (Sabrina)
-

Sabrina has been managing her assets on her own for years. She made some money with it. After several bad experiences she began to develop a serious trust issue with current financial advisors and recommendation from the banks. That being said, she would share the same concern if such website exists, that the website would use its clients for its own gain. It's also important to note she has no faith in funds in Taiwan. And she usually check out the track history of each fund manager before each investment. She made it very clear unless Warren Buffet is on the team and telling his true opinion she would continue to invest by herself.

**Facts:**

* Deposit of $100 USD monthly or minimum of 1K USD asset
* A fee is charged for each purchase + sale
* Around $20 USD minimum fee if no transaction in 400 days, or 1.2% management fee to assets

Ex-Financial Advisor (Cherry)
-

Cherry is an ex-finical advisor in Taiwan ZhangHua Bank. She attests that her bank charges a small transaction fee for each purchase and sale. But with no management fee involved. It is important to note she mentioned banks usually push the ETFs that are available to them. In that regard they do not act in customers best interest. She also told me advisor recommendations of ETFs is based on bank's guideline. It's stipulated from ETF agency given rating and processed by the bank that sells them. She said one transaction has a minimum of $12,000 (400 USD) or deposit $3000 (100 USD) per month.

Because her working experience she thinks it would be extremely hard to clear the Taiwan financial regulations.

A site that gives really good finical advises would help a lot of users already. We can leave the actual transaction to the users. They may use banks of their choice. The core value of the service is unbiased financial advises, and we need to show that clearly to our users.

Build Cases
-
A history of our past investment advices they worked out till the present. It would be nice if we could throw in some customer testimonies.

Simulate
-
Before the takes deposit or withdrawal it could have a checkbox to be checked if an user actually followed the recommended mix. Then simulate how much he would have made if it was followed. The site would have to build its reputation gradually.
