Finical Advisory
=
Apart from they might be undertrained. The cost is also much higher and they get commissions from activity that does not benefits the clients.

** Normal Charges **

These charges don't necessary lead to advisors screwing over their clients. But they are still significantly higher than WF or BM have to offer. 

* 1% of assets managed
* Flat rate of $500

** Controversial Charges **

These charges are tempting to advisors to screw over their clients

* Commission per each trade
* A “mark-up”: when one buys “house” products (such as bonds that the broker holds in inventory), or a “mark-down” when they are sold;

MVP
=
I have spend quite some time today to play with the [live demo](https://wwws.betterment.com/app/#) of BM. It's obvious to see how it helps users to set a finical target, and advise allocation to hit it. The UI is sleek, responsive and more importantly reliable. After all the finical space is in a business of trust. I  think we could learn a lot from the UI for our MVP.
